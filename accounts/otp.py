"""The login form used when OTP_ENABLED.

django-otp's ``OTPAuthenticationForm`` requires every user to present a token
and, since 1.6, to name the device explicitly, so the single-field login page
cannot satisfy it and a user who never enrolled is locked out. This form makes
OTP per user: a user with a confirmed TOTP device must enter a valid code, one
without a device logs in with the password alone. The device is chosen by the
server, so the page needs only the token field and a posted device id (which
django-otp does not check for confirmed status or ownership-by-type) is
ignored.
